            Educational Attainment and Literacy Rate
        </h1>
        <div>
            <p class="rate-desc">
                Almost all the household population 7 years old and over of Belison have attended or completed some levels of education represented by 96.7 percent while 3.3 percent represent the number of those who have not completed or attended any level of education. (Refer to Table DE-14) It can be notice that a high number of population is in the secondary education level. The data suggest that mostly of the population is relatively young. Data from 2015 census reveals that out of 5,370 population (35 years and over), 1,850 had finished their secondary education while 988 of them are college graduate or academic degree holder. In the age group 20-24, out of 1,097 population, 287 or 26% are academic degree holder while 407 had completed their secondary education.
                The Belisongnons value education so much. They consider it as the best way to have in order to make a living. It is the reason why Belison has a high literacy rate of 97.4 percent as per 2017 CBMS survey a little bit lower than the 2015 literacy rate of the province. Female population has a high literacy rate of 97.5 percent compare to the male population of 97.2%. Based on 2017 CBMS data illiteracy subsist in the age group of 65 years old and over which only shows that majority of the younger generation are able to read and write.
